        <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
        <div class="history">
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/" alt="This is a placeholder">
        <p>Kathy is a native Texan having grown up in a small town of about 4000 people.  She recalls much of her enjoyment from exploring the outdoors.  Living in a small town, which at the time was not very developed, she was able to play with her friends in the creeks and wooded areas of this rural town.  As a kid, Kathy wanted to be both a hairstylist and a business owner.  Years later, with drive and determination, she turned this dream into a reality.

        <p>At 16 years old, Kathy had gotten pregnant and had her first child.  As she looks back, she acknowledges this as being one of the biggest blessings in her life as it motivated her to work hard.  Kathy graduated High Scool and began working.  However, she never forgot about her dream.  At 24, Kathy obtained her cosmetology license and went into working for herself.  With her hard work and determination, Kathy built herself into the successful businesswoman she is today.
